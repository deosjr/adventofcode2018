# Advent of Code 2018

Coding in both Golang and Mercury.  
I try to solve problems quickly in Go and then slowly in Mercury.

Run any go code with for example `go run day1.go`  
Mercury code is run using for example `mmc day1.m` followed by `./day1`  
On Mac OSX you can just get mercury by running `brew install mercury`  
Otherwise see https://www.mercurylang.org/
